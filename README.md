# Energy-Generation-Consumption-and-Weather-Visualization

This is a visualization project done on the energy and weather of five cities in Spain namely Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid, Seville, and Valencia using **Python Pandas** library to preprocess the data and **Python Matplotlib** library for storytelling to understand energy consumption and generation as well as trends in weather. A 2014 to 2018 dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather?select=weather_features.csv) was used.

The tasks worked on were as follows:

* Data reading and cleaning
* Statistical description
* Application of preprocessing techniques
* Visualizations
* Confirmation about visualizations answering project questions
* Discussions and conclusions

Questions of interest which were answered with the visualization were:

1. What are the energy prices and demand levels from 2014 to 2018 and the ability of forecast results to be a good representation of actual results?
2. The humidity and temperature levels of the cities within spain and the type of weather the cities could experience.
3. The types of energy generating sources in Spain and their production energy quantities.
4. What quantity of energy generating sources in Spain are considered renewable.
5. To seasonally understand energy price changes by discovering how energy prices quarterly change in Spain.

Answers to these questions are found in section five of the Jupyter Notebook. For example, the visuals showed that renewable energy in Spain from
2014 to 2018 was from hydro water reservoir, wind, and solar.
